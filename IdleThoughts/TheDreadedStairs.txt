The dreaded Stairs and the secrets down them

I tell a tale of a man who bought a home with as many staircases as it had bedrooms. It had 3 bedrooms. Yes, I'm bragging. 

Each morning I awake at the top and descend it's many stairs to get to my kitchen, to my living room, and my front door. Should I wish to leave through the garage, add another set of stairs.

I don't mind it, really I don't. I get my stairs in and I'm fitter and healthier for it. But a descent each day can bring about a madness. A descent at midnight through the dark is human terror come to life. A darkness of the mind shown in neuvo-retro Film. Just as a storm still impacts the sturdy town, so does this depravity impacts my sturdy mind.

Through it all you may have a thought that will haunt you upon its first conception. Once it is thought, the thought will remain. You must understand I was pushed to my limits by the stairs demand.

This thought haunted me day and night. I thought of it at work, I thought of it while walking. And each step I took was a reminder of the dasterdly thought. Please do not judge me, because you haven't walked in my shoes, much less up and down my stairs.

16 steps per staircase. There are 3 staircases. That's 48 steps. Each step a unique step. Each one worn differently than the rest. Pet hair in such a way as to distinguish each step from their sibling. 

Each sibling aware of my secret. Each one judging. Each stair communicating with its neighbour, each one knowing, each one whispering. Had you experienced this, you would have wiped it from you memory.

I wont torture you much longer. I hope you've heeded my warning.

If I kept a pair of trousers on the ground floor, I wouldn't have to go up and down the steps so much.
