# a game where work sucks in multiple dimensions.

the game starts in a cubicle with the character player (user created)
the player engages with objects, has inventory, and a notepad.
the player is called to see their boss and given work.
the player looks deeper and sees the work doesn't matter, and doesn't contribute to anything,
the player can then decide how to proceed. this may be based on character attributes at character creation. or a path of action.
paths of action are to be many and varied. 
if the player decides to throw their computer in the bin, what happens then?
