# first scene - office cubicle
the player is working on their computer when an email arrives.
the email is from the boss and ask them to come see them IMMEDIATELI
going to the bosses office, you are in trouble for the new team not being complete yet. this OSS the first you are hearing of the task.
you discover the team is nonsense and purely busy work.
the player decides how to proceed, but ultimately fails to find meaning.
the player comes across a frequency switcher in the archives
the frequency switcher lets you change the current office setting to a medieval setting. 
the tasks are rephrased, objects changed, but things mostly remain the same.
the king has given you an impossible and useless task, and you are trying to survive.
by completing one, you complete both.
however on the medieval world, you can access secret passages in the castle that aren't present in an office. 
you phone is must a plank of wood. etc.
the king sits in the highest tower, your boss sits on the top floor. the king can becaccessed by climbing steps, the boss can be accessed by using a lift.
one solution means you take the stairs, another is you take the lift.
